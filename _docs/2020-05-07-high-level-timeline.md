This high level timeline outlines the main project phases. Within each phase the work is described, alongside the milestones that we expect to reach. All the work is to be completed by Studio 24, unless W3C is explicitly mentioned. 

This is not a final schedule. We expect it to be iterated during the project as our planning progresses and key decisions are made. A change log will be kept to highlight amends made after the first publish date. 

There is a [visual version that can be seen on whimsical](https://whimsical.com/HTvf2qL3cNpprju5owbAg6) and a textual version below.

\**Update: 3 July 2020*

Based on additional research we are doing in the IA phase, project dates have moved along by around three weeks.

**Update: 29 July 2020*

The discussion of the top-level site map with W3C last week revealed a few more areas to consider for the site architecture. We have also changed the approach on the design phase so that it runs after the user experience work is completed, it extends the timeline of the project but will result in a more efficient design phase. This has moved the delivery dates along by around 2 months. A few other minor deliverables were also been updated to fit with the new timings.
