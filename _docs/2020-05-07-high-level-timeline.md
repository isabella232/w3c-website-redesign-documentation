This high level timeline outlines the main project phases. Within each phase the work is described, alongside the milestones that we expect to reach. All the work is to be completed by Studio 24, unless W3C is explicitly mentioned. 

This is not a final schedule. We expect it to be iterated during the project as our planning progresses and key decisions are made. A change log will be kept to highlight amends made after the first publish date. 

There is a [visual version that can be seen on whimsical](https://whimsical.com/TVJQzgH1VoxqBAj1gG6mYm) and a textual version below.
