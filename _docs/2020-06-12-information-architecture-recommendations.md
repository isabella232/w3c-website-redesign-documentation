## Introduction

This Information Architecture (IA) report documents the research and analysis carried out by Studio 24, to identify the needs of the primary users of the W3C site, and combine these insights with the company goals, to deliver a proposed new IA structure for the W3C site.

The research comprises a gathering of information from various sources, including the original company goals stated in the RFP, a list of primary users and the design preferences provided by the W3C team, interviews with key stakeholders and responses from a user survey, and a content audit to group existing site content. This research was analysed and output as job stories, grouped by user type, and ordered by priority of user.

This has informed the creation of the new structure for the W3C website, presented in the form of a new sitemap and wireframes. We have also included recommendations on dealing with archived content.

### Create wireframes

Each of the Job Stories generated by the user research has been translated into a new site structure, which is presented in these wireframes.

The role of wireframes is to assist in the exploration and testing of user experience and organisation of information. It shapes templates and aids content and scope discussions. Further content and visual design will be layered on top at later stages.

As part of the IA phase the wireframes incorporate the findings within the IA report such as business goals, stakeholder interviews, user and job stories.

We advise clicking through the wireframes as you would if you were a user, this will help you have a clearer understanding of the proposed journeys through the site.

#### Understanding limitations

Please note: The wireframe is produced at a width of 1280px and uses InVision, so is presented as flat images. We don’t think this tool is fully accessible, but we’re happy to have a call to explain our thinking in these wires.


### Dealing with archived content

There is a large volume of content on the w3.org site and when the new site launches we’ll have a combination of new pages, old pages in the 2008 design, old pages in different design, and plain HTML pages.

We need different strategies for this, our initial recommendations are as follows. Our recommendations are based on the URLs remaining as they are. W3C have indicated a preference to keep URLs as they are and not move old content to a separate URL space (e.g. archive.w3.org).


#### Existing pages with current or relevant content



*   This content should be moved to the new design wherever possible (ideally in the new CMS). 
*   If necessary, the content should be reviewed and updated.
*   If appropriate, the URL can be updated and the old URL redirect to the new URL.
*   E.g. About page - [https://www.w3.org/Consortium/](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/)   

Please note we will make recommendations on URLs in a separate document.


#### News pages with old content and 2008 design



*   News and blog pages are of historical interest.
*   This content should be moved to the new design wherever possible. 
*   E.g. [https://www.w3.org/blog/2008/11/w3c-validator-now-with-html5/](https://www.w3.org/blog/2008/11/w3c-validator-now-with-html5/) 


#### Existing pages with old content and 2008 design



*   If content is no longer updated it can be considered “archived content”.
*   We recommend W3C review after how long a page is considered “archived”. This means it’s no longer updated and kept for historical interest (and to avoid breaking URLs).
*   For archived pages we recommend leaving the page design as-is (e.g. keep the 2008 design) and add a banner to indicate this page is archived. See example below.
*   This is the approach the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/about/) and University of Cambridge take with archived content.

#### Existing pages with old content and a different design



*   If content is no longer updated it can be considered “archived content”.
*   For archived pages we recommend leaving the page design as-is and add a banner to indicate this page is archived.
*   E.g. [https://www.w3.org/WAI/IndieUI/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/IndieUI/) 


#### Existing pages with old content and no design



*   Any pages with no design can be left as-is. 
*   E.g. [https://www.w3.org/Proposal.html](https://www.w3.org/Proposal.html) 


#### Linking to archived content from a new page



*   We recommend looking at a way to highlight when a page link goes to an archived piece of content. 
*   This may be text “archived content” along with an icon.
