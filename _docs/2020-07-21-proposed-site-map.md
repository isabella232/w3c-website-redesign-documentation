You can view it [visually in whimsical](https://whimsical.com/XVTy5CCcHTQdTuKBcnmmom) or as a text version below.

Additional documentation to support this proposed site map includes:

* Our [IA recommendations report (Google presentation)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V1LttqpEerve9m69xZIabpc-2VYThBbgGp_HC0SpoSk/edit?usp=sharing) which documents current site problems and our proposed solutions to them
* The [existing site map](/docs/current-site-map), for a comparison point.
