This is v2 of our proposed site map for the W3C website. You can view it as a text version below.

Additional information has been added to help explain the purpose of each section. Please note it is likely 
there will be changes to deep pages (level 3 and below) may change during the build of the site as content is updated 
and created. 

Additional documentation to support this proposed site map includes:

* The [existing site map](/docs/current-site-map), for a comparison point. 

## Top-level sections

* Home
* Standards
* Groups
* Get Involved
* Resources
* News and Insights
* About

## User login navigation

Links associated with whether a user is logged in. Due to full page caching a JavaScript solution will likely need to be used 
to implement the logged-in state (if possible).  

Please note navigation links below suffixed with the note _(requires login)_ mean the content can only be accessed if the 
user is logged in.
