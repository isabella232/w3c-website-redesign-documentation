This is v2 of our proposed site map for the W3C website. You can view it as a text version below.

Additional information has been added to help explain the purpose of each section. Please note it is likely 
there will be changes to deep pages (level 3 and below) may change during the build of the site as content is updated 
and created. 

Additional documentation to support this proposed site map includes:

* The [existing site map](/docs/current-site-map), for a comparison point. 

## Top-level sections

* Home
* Standards
* Groups
* Resources
* About
* Get Involved
* News and Insights

## User account menu

Links associated with whether a user is logged in. Due to full page caching a JavaScript solution will likely need to be used 
to implement the logged-in state (if possible).  

If not logged in:

* Sign in
* Register 

If logged in:

* [Username or name]
* My account

Please note at present we have not included a logout link since this is not technically possible with basic auth login.
This can change as the login system is replaced with the new W3C auth system.

## Footer menu

A limited number of key links focussed around legal and help information.

* Home
* Contact
* Help and FAQ
* Privacy policy
* Legal
* Site map
* System status

Please note the footer will also include a copyright statement. For example:

> Copyright © 1994-2000 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) | Proudly hosted by MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang
