This is v2 of our proposed site map for the W3C website. You can view it as a text version below.

Additional documentation to support this proposed site map includes:

* Google slides which summarise our [Content design work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16VQIUv2ugeZG8mNmAtZtHnaMo2E4y9x7YxKA_tPq-Xw/view), this informs the updated Information Architecture.
* [Wireframes](/docs/content-wireframes) which detail our work on content hierarchy, further explained in the Content design slides.
* Google sheet of [the proposed sitemap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9pm5HWzcidtLPCeFRz4F0Ir4TT3oOK54FlEEd3IXUE/view) which list all pages and their URLs.
* The [existing site map](/docs/current-site-map), for a comparison point.

## Sentence case for navigation labels

We recommend the use of sentence case for page titles: only use upper-case for the first word and proper nouns. Sentence case tends to be easier to scan for users. 

See [Sentence case v title case](https://www.sallybagshaw.com.au/articles/sentence-case-v-title-case/) and [Readability Guidelines: Capital letters](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/grammar-points/capital-letters/).
