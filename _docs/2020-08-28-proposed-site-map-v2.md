This is v2 of our proposed site map for the W3C website. You can view it as a text version below.

Additional documentation to support this proposed site map includes:

* Google slides which summarise our [Content design work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16VQIUv2ugeZG8mNmAtZtHnaMo2E4y9x7YxKA_tPq-Xw/view), this informs the updated Information Architecture.
* [Wireframes](/docs/content-wireframes) which detail our work on content hierarchy, further explained in the Content design slides.
* Google sheet of [the proposed sitemap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9pm5HWzcidtLPCeFRz4F0Ir4TT3oOK54FlEEd3IXUE/view) which list all pages and their URLs.
* The [existing site map](/docs/current-site-map), for a comparison point.

## General content recommendations

### Sentence case for navigation labels and headings

We recommend the use of sentence case for page titles: only use upper-case for the first word and proper nouns (i.e. the 
name of a unique thing or entity).  

For example:
* Updated Candidate Recommendation: WebRTC 1.0: real-time communication between browsers
 
Not:
* Updated Candidate Recommendation: WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers

The W3C site currently uses all caps or title case (most words start with an upper-case letter). Sentence case is easier to scan 
for most users; it improves accessibility and usability.  

See [Sentence case v title case](https://www.sallybagshaw.com.au/articles/sentence-case-v-title-case/), [Readability Guidelines: Capital letters](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/grammar-points/capital-letters/), 
and [Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision](https://www.w3.org/TR/low-vision-needs/#capitalization).

It may be useful to start a style guide while updating content for the W3C site, to help authors understand when it's OK to capitalise.

### Reduce use of FAQs

> If you write clear web content that is easy to navigate and answers your readers questions, you will not need to create a FAQ. FAQs often cause your readers more frustration. 

[Plain language: Avoid FAQs](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/web/avoid-faqs/) 

Please note where possible we plan to merge FAQ content into pages and remove FAQs. This requires a content review of FAQ
content before this is done, which will be reviewed with W3C in the design phase. For now, we have left FAQs in the navigation 
and wireframes.

## Detailed site map

Please note navigation links below suffixed with _(requires login)_ mean the content can only be accessed if the 
user is logged in. Any navigation links suffixed with _(cross-link)_ mean the content primarily lives in another section 
and is cross-linked from here.

When designing the site we may only display two or three levels in the primary navigation. The folllowing sitemap illustrates 
the main pages for the high-level W3C site.
