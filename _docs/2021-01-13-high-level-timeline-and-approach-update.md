The high-level timeline was last updated in [July 2020](https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/high-level-timeline/), and as the project as progressed since then our approach and timeline has adapted in response. Here are some of the driving reasons behind this:

1. The decision to build the site as a headless CMS changed the build approach. This affected the timings, but also means the W3C systems team can work alongside us on the front-end app integration, to better share knowledge and speed up this phase of development.
2. Some areas of content which are more complex to review than others have required input from a wider group or stakeholders in W3C, such as the TR listing page. This has required more time to review and respond to feedback on both sides.
3. Some areas of complex interaction, such as the header, have taken additional time to research best practice, design and specify, and agree with the W3C team.

The high-level timeline and project approach has been adjusted with this in mind. It starts in January 2021 for ease of readability. The previous version can be accessed on the link above, any changes to this version will be kept via a change log.

There is a [visual version that can be seen on whimsical](https://whimsical.com/project-approach-v1-4-7F2h75BXXHKKvvR3zDfUUy) and a textual version below.
