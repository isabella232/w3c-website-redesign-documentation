We have written and agreed with W3C a specification for the Symfony front-end application we will build. Its purpose is to deliver the working web pages, the “frontend”. This application reads content in from Craft, which acts as a Headless CMS, and other data sources as required. Content will be passed to the template layer, and web pages are rendered via the Twig templating system.

The full specification can be read on the [Front-end delivery: a Symfony application to deliver web pages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nomJ3nlawS3sYAJBGZ8f2xzf1SysLGF8dLrl_L1oScc) Google doc.
