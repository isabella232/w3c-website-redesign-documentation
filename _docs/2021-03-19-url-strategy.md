This document outlines our recommendations for URLs and redirects for the new W3C website. This document was originally 
written in August, 2020, and updated in early 2021 after decisions were made on various aspects of the front-end site 
build (e.g. [internationalization](/docs/internationalization-approach-agreed/)).
