Following consultations with W3C representatives, we can announce the decision to use Apollo[^1], [^2] as the basis for our front end work on the W3C website redesign.

It is worth clarifying that Apollo is not a front end framework in the way that Bootstrap is. It is better described as the Studio 24 approach to front end development. It really is true that naming things is both tricky and important!

## What Apollo will mean for this project

We believe the most consistent, performant and accessible user experiences are delivered by prioritising the use of native, semantic HTML. This is what is at the heart of Apollo.

This core content layer is progressively enhanced with the addition of carefully considered CSS for visual aesthetics, and vanilla JavaScript for enhanced interactivity.

In short, Apollo will provide a solid, light-weight starting point for our front end development work.
