We've created two additional user surveys to gather more information on user needs, challenges and interactions with the following areas of the W3C website:

1. [Standards / specifications / technical reports](https://www.surveygizmo.eu/s3/90248823/W3C-re-design-Standards-Specifications-Technical-Reports)
2. [Groups](https://www.surveygizmo.eu/s3/90248825/W3C-re-design-Groups) 

These are open from 22nd June and will be analysed the first week in July.

They were sent out to the public via a number of channels:

* W3C LinkedIn
* W3C Twitter and Studio 24 Twitter
* W3C Slack channel
* W3C Wiki
* W3C Website redesign group
