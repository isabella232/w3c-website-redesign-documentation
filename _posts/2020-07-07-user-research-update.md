Following the interviews last week, and all the excellent insights we received, we are going to take the following approach to define the site IA.

1. Collate and analyse research; highlight patterns that appear.

2. Test the current site navigation via Treejack to establish a baseline for future navigation testing.

3. Make recommendations on changes to be made to the IA and propose new site map.

4. In parallel to the above:
- Document the high-level in/out of scope areas.
- Map existing user journeys where relevant

5. Discuss IA recommendations with W3C (and iterate as required).

6. Test new proposed site map on Treejack.

7. Once agreed, implement changes in wireframes.
