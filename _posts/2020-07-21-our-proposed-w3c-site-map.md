If you've been following progress on this project, you'll know that we've done a lot of user research to identify site users and problems with the exiting site structure and navigation.

We have pulled all of this research and analysis together to recommend a new site Information Architecture, which we are looking forward to discussing and getting feedback on. You can read our proposal in the following documents:

[IA Recommendations (Google presentation)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V1LttqpEerve9m69xZIabpc-2VYThBbgGp_HC0SpoSk/edit?usp=sharing)\
This documents the problems we identified and our proposed solutions
