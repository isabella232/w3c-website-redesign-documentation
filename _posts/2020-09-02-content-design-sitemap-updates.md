The following updates have been made to the content design and sitemap documents:

* Updated [create account step 1](/wireframes/create-account-step1/) wireframe to simplify password requirements (only require min length)
* Updated [Content Design slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16VQIUv2ugeZG8mNmAtZtHnaMo2E4y9x7YxKA_tPq-Xw/view#slide=id.g8bd347c6dc_0_0) with minor clarifications
* Updated [sitemap](/docs/proposed-site-map-v2/) with changes:
  * Added Groups > Organizations back since page is accessible by all users with Member access
  * Changed Get Involved > "How to participate" to "How to get an account" to clearly reflect intent of page to explain how a user registers for an account across the different use cases
  * Removed Involved > Member home > Create an account since "Member home" is only accessible by users with Member access
  * Removed Mail cross-link from About > Policies since this is redundant
