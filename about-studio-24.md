# About Studio 24

The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) was founded by the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, and is responsible for key standards that make the World Wide Web work (such as HTML, CSS, accessibility, web payments and more). Studio 24 are working with W3C to redesign w3.org to more effectively communicate what the organisation does with a modern, inclusive, usable website.</p>

[Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/) is an independent digital agency based in Cambridge, UK. We’ve always believed in building a better web, using standards to make sure the sites we build are accessible to all regardless of who you are, what internet access you have, what device you’re using, or any disability you may have. Our company mission to bring together human-centred design and open source technology is ideally fitted to a client such as W3C.

The project is led by [Simon R Jones](https://www.studio24.net/team/simon-jones/), Founder & Managing Director, who has a background in digital technology and UX. The team is a passionate bunch of web designers, content strategists and developers committed to making a better web. Needless to say, the team are very excited to be working with W3C!
