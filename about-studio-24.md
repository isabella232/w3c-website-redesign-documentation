# About Studio 24

[Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/) is an independent digital agency based in Cambridge, UK. We’ve always believed in building a better web, using standards to make sure the sites we build are accessible to all regardless of who you are, what internet access you have, what device you’re using, or any disability you may have. This has always been a value of Studio 24, and we even have our own Accessibility Lead Developer, Carlos Eriksson, to help move this forward. Our company mission to bring together human-centred design and open source technology is ideally fitted to a client such as W3C.

## The project team

The team is a passionate bunch of web designers, content strategists and developers committed to making a better web. Needless to say, the team is very excited to be working with W3C for just some of the following reasons...

Content strategy is an interesting area for this project, there is a wealth of content on w3.org. While the project is focussed on higher-level pages, we’ll need to review how the site content is organised, making sure it meets its purpose and is easily understood by users.

URI persistence is an interesting and connected topic. Web page addresses (URLs, which are also URIs) are the backbone of the web and it is W3C’s policy not to change them.

Technical strategy will also be a fascinating area. The W3C was founded in the early days of the web in 1994, which means they will have a variety of different systems and ways of managing web pages. Coming up with something modern and manageable will be a good challenge!

### Simon Jones, Founder & Managing Director and project lead

Simon studied English Literature at Anglia Ruskin University. While there he learnt HTML, helped start the first Varsity Online website and started his journey on the web. Simon founded Studio 24 in 1999 and for over 20 years he has been bringing a mix of strategic insight and technical expertise to client projects. Outside of work Simon is a trustee of the Cambridge Film Trust who present the annual Cambridge Film Festival.

### Ian Axton, Creative Director

Ian joined the studio in 2014, bringing with him a wealth of expertise having helped brands such as Sony, English Heritage and Centrepoint to connect with their audiences. Ian heads up the Studio 24 creative team and works alongside the development team to ensure a seamless and efficient delivery on all projects. He is an advocate of clean, user centred design that allows people to positively engage with brands and their content. In his free time, Ian can be found in the pottery studio knee deep in creative projects with his family.

### Ben Challenor, Data Strategist

Before joining Studio 24 as a Digital Marketing Executive in 2015, Ben had spent several years in Australia where he worked as a freelance digital marketing consultant. Ben’s role evolved to Data and Content Strategist - reflecting the strategic work he had been undertaking for clients to help them analyse, optimise and improve their digital performance. Ben loves cinema and is part of the ‘Bums on Seats’ film review show on Cambridge105 and is co-host of the ‘Sudden Double Deep: The Triple Bill Title Podcast’. 

### Carlos Eriksson, Front-end Developer and accessibility lead

Carlos believes that the web is built by people, for people. And if we want to make a better web we need to include people from all walks of life. Carlos began his digital journey with a degree in audio visual communication. But the real inspiration for his dedication to digital accessibility came from working closely with people with permanent disabilities. At Studio 24 Carlos has worked with HS2, Heathrow and Crown Commercial Service. In his spare time, Carlos is part of a mentoring programme which supports women to get into tech. 

### Nicola Saunders, Front-end Developer
