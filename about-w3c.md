# About W3C

The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) was founded by the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, and is responsible for key standards that make the World Wide Web work (such as HTML, CSS, accessibility, web payments and more). 

W3C is incrementally redesigning its website and revising the information architecture to:
* Show the world who we are and what we offer.
* Improve the organization and usability of the website for key audiences.
* Communicate the W3C brand more effectively.
* Motivate people to participate in the organization.

W3C are doing this because their website is supposed to show the world who they are and what they offer. While the current website is well-designed:
* It is hard to navigate.
* It is out-dated in look and non-consistently responsive.
* It has too much content that is unsorted.
* It lacks a cohesive look.


When the project started, Coralie Mercier, Head of W3C Marketing & Communications said: 
>“I am delighted to partner with Studio 24 as we embark on this project. We haven’t done a website redesign in a very long time. In fact, in the 21 years I’ve been with the W3C, I remember only 3 different designs, the current one being from a decade ago. Redesigning our website is crucial to improve the overall experience of those who depend on us for our Web standards work. As W3C makes the Web work for everyone, Studio 24 will help make our website work better for everyone.”
