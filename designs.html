    <h1>Designs</h1>

    <p class="fs-4 fw-300">
        During the design phase we create "flat" designs to illustrate design elements and page layouts. Please do not
        be concerned if imagery and text is incorrect. You may see areas of Latin text and stock imagery which is used
        in a purely representative way.
    </p>

    <p class="fs-4 fw-300">
        Our focus in the design phase is to agree a design direction and high-level styles. These are then built into
        working HTML/CSS web pages, where the design is iterated to ensure it meets business and user needs.
