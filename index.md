  <h1>Working in the open on the W3C website redesign</h1>

    <p>During 2020, Studio 24 are proud to be working with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on a redesign of their website
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a> to more effectively communicate what the organisation does with a modern, inclusive, usable website.</p>

  <p>Weâ€™ve set this project site up to help document the process, to share our decisions, processes and learnings. We will blog about key aspects of the design and development including information architecture (IA), design, front-end development, internationalization, accessibility and content management.</p>

    <p>This site is a collection of regular updates and documents we are delivering as part of this project.</p>
    
    <p>You can also subscribe to updates to this website via an <a href="/feeds/updates.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>
